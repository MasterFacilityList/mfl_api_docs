Using the API - basic principles
==================================
.. include:: substitutes.txt

All the material here assumes that you already have access to an
MFL test environment.

See :doc:`07_sandbox` and :doc:`01_evaluator_install` or :doc:`02_developer_install`
for information on how to get access to a test environment.

The MFL v2 project subscribes to the `API First`_ approach. It is **built to
interoperate**. We "eat our own dog food" by insisting that the official
user interfaces be just one more set of API clients, with no special
privileges.

This guide is for the authors of client applications ( applications that
consume the RESTful web e.g. :doc:`09_services` ). Those who would like to make changes to
the MFL API server code itself should refer to the :doc:`14_workflow` guide.

The MFL 2 API is "RESTish". We subscribe to the principles of `REST`_ but
are not pedantic about it. It is built using the excellent
`Django REST Framework`_.

HTTP and HTTPS
---------------
All API actions are based on HTTP and its verbs e.g. ``GET`` and ``POST``.

=========== ====================================================================
 HTTP Verb   Description
=========== ====================================================================
 HEAD        Used to **retrieve header information** about a resource
 GET         Used to **retrieve a resource** and for any **read-only operation**
 POST        Used to **create a resource** and sometimes to change it
 PUT         Used to **mutate an existing resource**. We, however, encourage the use of ``PATCH`` instead of ``PUT`` whenever possible.
 PATCH       Used to **edit** an already existing resource
 DELETE      Used to **delete** an already existing resource
=========== ====================================================================

Production instances should always run over HTTPS.

Data Format
------------
The MFL API server supports JSON for all API endpoints.

*Some* endpoints support CSV and Excel output. This will be indicated in the
relevant sections of the documentation.

The preferred data format is JSON. **We strongly encourage you to use JSON**
- you will find it to be more reliable, since it is the format used by the
official front-ends and is therefore extensively tested.

In order to request a specific format, you will need to learn how to use
`content negotiation`_ .

.. _`content negotiation`: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/content-negotiation/

Content Negotiation using headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Send the correct ``Accept`` header. For example:

**To get json**

     curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000/api/common/contacts/

**To get csv**

     curl -i -H "Accept: application/csv" -H "Content-Type: application/csv" http://localhost:8000/api/common/contacts/

**To get a resource in Microsoft Excel format**

    curl -i -H "Accept: application/xlsx" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" http://localhost:8000/api/common/contacts/

Please note that the examples above do not factor in :doc:`05_authentication`.

Content negotiation using query parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Append a ``?format=<>`` ``GET`` parameter. For example:

 * to get JSON ( the default ), append ``?format=json`` to the URL
 * to get CSV append ``?format=csv`` to the URL
 * to get Excel, append ``?format=excel`` to the URL

Common fields
--------------------
**All** |mfl| resources have the following fields:

============= ===============================================================================
 Field          Description
============= ===============================================================================
 ``id``         A UUID. This is the database record's primary key.
 ``created``    An ISO 8601 timestamp ( UTC time zone ) that indicates when the resource was created
 ``updated``    An ISO 8601 timestamp ( UTC time zone ) that shows when the last update occured
 ``active``     A boolean; will be set to ``false`` when the record is retired
 ``deleted``    A boolean; will be set to ``true`` when the record is removed. The API will in-fact not return deleted items by default.
 ``created``    The ID of the user that created the record. The user model is the only one with non UUID primary keys.
 ``updated``    The ID of the user that last updated the record.
============= ===============================================================================

The example listing below clearly shows the shared fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "count": 5,
        "next": null,
        "previous": null,
        "results": [
            {
                "id": "16f7593f-0a21-41b6-87f1-ef2c4ec7e029",
                "created": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.345994Z",
                "updated": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.346007Z",
                "deleted": false,
                "active": true,
                "name": "POSTAL",
                "description": null,
                "created_by": 1,

                "description": null,
                "created_by": 1,
                "updated_by": 1
            },
            {
                "id": "f4e835d3-e6a4-4d2d-9d37-344a3da1bb0a",
                "created": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.338468Z",
                "updated": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.338481Z",
                "deleted": false,
                "active": true,
                "name": "LANDLINE",
                "description": null,
                "created_by": 1,
                "updated_by": 1
            },
            {
                "id": "68281bd2-d616-418d-ab01-616a225b643b",
                "created": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.334496Z",
                "updated": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.334510Z",
                "deleted": false,
                "active": true,
                "name": "MOBILE",
                "description": null,
                "created_by": 1,
                "updated_by": 1
            },
            {
                "id": "b2ce5bc9-0c73-4586-b5d2-e96c69b90b85",
                "created": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.328938Z",
                "updated": "2015-05-03T02:30:26.328956Z",
                "deleted": false,
                "active": true,
                "name": "EMAIL",
                "description": null,
                "created_by": 1,
                "updated_by": 1
            }
        ]
    }

These fields are exposed via filters in most list endpoints. The examples
below show those filters in use:

==================== ===============================================================================
 Filter                 Example and examples
==================== ===============================================================================
 ``updated_before``     Returns results where the date is less than or equal to the supplied timestamp. An example of a valid query is ``GET`` ``/api/facilities/facilities/?updated_before=2014-05-06T10:36:45.112488Z``
 ``updated_after``      Returns results where the date is greater than or equal to the supplied timestamp. An example of a valid query is ``GET`` ``/api/facilities/facilities/?updated_after=2014-05-06T10:36:45.112488Z``
 ``created_before``     Same as for ``updated_before``, but operates on creation timestamps
 ``created_after``      Same as for ``updated_after``, but operates on creation timestamps
 ``is_active``          Can be used to retrieve active or inactive results only e.g ``GET`` ``/api/facilities/facilities/?is_active=false``
==================== ===============================================================================

.. note::

    Filters can be combined / chained.

Documentation examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All the examples in this documentation will use the recommended JSON format.

Data notations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The example below demonstrates the manner in which example JSON payloads
in the documentation should be interpreted:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "gender": "M",
        "age": 33,
        "houses": [
            {
                "city": "Nairobi",
                "type": "Flat"
            },
            {
                "city": "Mombasa",
                "type": "Bungalow"
            }
        ],
        "phone": {
            "work": "8781923",
            "home": "213789123"
        }
    }

This table describes the data above

================  =================  ===============================
 Property          Type               Description
================  =================  ===============================
 name              string             Name of the person
 age               integer            Age of the person
 gender            string             Gender of the person
 houses            list of objects    A list of houses the person owns
 houses[ ].city    string             The city in which the house is in
 houses[ ].type    string             The type of the house
 phone             object             The person's phone numbers
 phone.work        string             Work phone number
 phone.home        string             Home phone number
================  =================  ===============================

The *[ ]* notation is used to indicate a property of every object in a list.
For example, ``houses[ ].city`` means every object in the list ``houses``
has a property called ``city``.

Data types
^^^^^^^^^^
The data types are standard `JSON`_. The MFL API uses `UUIDs`_ for its
primary keys.

===========  =====================  =====================
 Data type    JSON Representation    Description
===========  =====================  =====================

.. _`UUIDs`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier

URLs
----
URLs in this document shall be written in shortform, excluding the scheme and
domain (or IP) from which |mfl| can be accessed.

For a production system, the scheme shall always be ``https``, unless
otherwise specified.

For example, if |mfl| is running from the IP *192.168.1.56*, a full URL could be ``https://192.168.1.56/api/common/contacts/``. In the documentation, the
URL shall be written as ``/api/common/contacts/``, exluding the scheme and
domain (or IP).

.. note::

    **All URLs have a trailing slash** unless specified otherwise.
    For example, the url ``https://192.168.1.56/v1/claims/`` is not equivalent
    to the url ``https://192.168.1.56/v1/claims``.
    The latter will result in a ``HTTP 404`` (Not Found) response

URL Parameters
-----------------
Any API endpoints that support url parameters shall be specified in the following format:

.. code-block:: text

    /api/common/counties/<value>/

For example to retrieve a county by its ID ( UUID ),  the URL shall be
specified as:

.. code-block:: text

    /api/common/counties/<id>/

e.g. ``/api/common/counties/89d8f3dd698b46e6a052f355a231858d/``


URL Query Parameters
----------------------
Any API endpoints that support query parameters shall be specified in the following format:

.. code-block:: text

    /api/common/counties/?name=<value>

For example to query the county endpoint by ``name``, the URL shall be
specified as:

.. code-block:: text

    /api/common/counties/?name=<name>

e.g. ``/api/common/counties/?name=Nairobi``

Dates and times
-----------------
All dates and times shall be represented as datetime strings in
`ISO 8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ format i.e.

.. code-block:: text

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

e.g. ``2015-03-30T15:23:89Z``

If timezone is to be included, the timezone shall be ``UTC``, thus the format becomes

.. code-block:: text

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+0000

e.g. ``2015-03-30T15:23:89+0000``

Any date that does not have a timezone shall be assumed to be ``UTC``.

UUIDs
-----
UUIDs are used as unique record identifiers for each record in |mfl|.
All UUIDs used in |mfl| are `version 4 UUIDs <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html>`_.

HTTP Errors
-----------
400 (Bad Request)
    This error occurs if the request given to the server is malformed or does not meet certain criteria e.g. invalid data.

401 (Unauthorized)
    The request to access a resource was unauthorized. (:doc:`05_authentication`)

403 (Forbidden)
    The authorized user does not have permission to access a resource (:doc:`05_authentication`)

404 (Not found)
    The requested resource was not found

410 (Gone)
    The requested resource has been removed

500 (Server Error)
    A server error has occurred

Pagination
----------
Endpoints that return multiple items will be paginated with a page size of 25
by default. All endpoints returning a list of items shall have the following
format:

.. code-block:: text

    GET /api/common/constituencies/?page=2


.. code-block:: javascript

    {
    "count": 290,
    "next": "http://localhost:8000/api/common/constituencies/?page=3",
    "previous": "http://localhost:8000/api/common/constituencies/",
    "results": [
        {
            ... // list of items requested, in this case constituencies
        ]
    }

A client can request a larger page size by specifying the ``page_size`` parameter
e.g ``/api/common/contacts/?page_size=100``. There page size limit is selected at
server configuration time; it will usually be around 1000 items.

Audit trail
-------------
The API server provides an audit trail for all non third-party resources.
This audit trail can be accessed on **detail endpoints** by appending an
``include_audit=true`` query parameter.

For example, if there was a contact with the id
``28d2a0c8-40f4-4686-97d0-d7c6f453fcb3``, a ``GET`` request to
``/api/common/contacts/28d2a0c8-40f4-4686-97d0-d7c6f453fcb3/?include_audit=true``
would return a payload that has a `revisions` key that contains a
representation of every past revision of that specific contact.

Search
--------
Every **list** endpoint supports **full text** search. Search is implemented
as a filter, using the `search` query parameter.

For example, to search for contacts that have the word "meru" in them, the
query would be ``/api/common/contacts/?search=meru``.
