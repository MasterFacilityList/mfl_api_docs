Community Health Units
=========================
This chapter assumes that the reader is familiar with the general
principles explained in the :doc:`06_api` chapter.

Kenya's community health strategy relies on community health workers for
outreach at the lowest levels ( embedded into communities ). These workers are
organized into community health units. The second edition of the Master
Facilities List provides APIs for the management of community health units.

This chapter concerns itself with the resources that model community health
units and link them to facilities.

.. note::

    Community health units are an extension of the Master Facilities List. A
    community health unit is a health service delivery structure within a
    defined geographic area covering a population of approximately 5,000
    people.

    Each unit is assigned 2 Community Health Extension Workers ( CHEWs ) and community health volunteers who offer promotie, preventative and basic
    curative services.

    Each unit is governed by a Community Health Committee ( CHC ) and is
    **linked to a specific health facility**.

    The role of a community health unit is to bring services closer to the
    people that need them. Those services include:

        * Water and sanitation hygiene; e.g. Faecal management, Household water treatment and demonstrations on hand washing with soap, etc.
        * Advice on maternal and child health e.g. Immunization, Individual birth plan, etc.
        * Provision of Family planning commodities.
        * Growth monitoring for children under 5 years.
        * Deworming of children.
        * Provision of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs).
        * Management of diarrhea, injuries, wounds, jiggers and other minor illnesses.
        * Provision of Information, Education & Communication (IEC) materials
        * Defaulter tracing (ART, TB and Immunization)
        * Referrals to health facilities
        * First Aid Services

The implementation of community health units in this API is semi-independent.
The units connect to the rest of MFL at only one point - their linkage to
facilities.

Community Health Unit Approvers
----------------------------------
The community health approvers resource holds the details of entities that are
involved in approval of community health units.

The known approvers can be listed by issuing a ``GET`` to ``/api/chul/approvers/``. To register a new approving entity, you need to supply a
``name``, ``description`` and ``abbreviation``. The following example
illustrates that:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "name": "Division of Community Health Services",
        "description": "Division of Community Health Services, Ministry of Health",
        "abbreviation": "DCHS"
    }

Community Health Unit Statuses
--------------------------------
The community health unit statuses that are known / available can be listed at
``/api/chul/statuses/`` via ``GET``. These will be used to mark the current
status of a community health unit, and when analysing the status of registered
community health units.

To create a new status, you need to ``POST`` a ``name`` and a ``description``.
Here is an example payload:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "name": "ACTIVE",
        "description": "Actively Deployed"
    }

.. note::

    This reflects the operational status of the Community Health Unit.

Community Health Units
------------------------
Community health units can be listed via ``GET`` to ``/api/chul/units/``.

To add a new community health unit, ``POST`` to ``/api/chul/units/``, ``POST``
a payload that has a ``name``, ``facility`` and ``status``. For the facility
and status, the ``id`` s are sent ( foreign keys ).

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "name": "Gachie Health Unit",
        "facility": "2927d31f-b1a0-4d17-93b0-ea648af7b9f0",
        "status": "0e2ba3fc-9c81-4c30-b52e-b62664462cb7"
    }

.. note::

    The community health unit ``code`` is auto-assigned. Immediately after
    creating the facility record, the code ( and other auto-assigned fields )
    will be inserted in the response.

Community Health Unit Contacts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A community health unit may be linked to zero or more contacts. The contacts
will have been created at ``/api/common/contacts/`` using APIs that are
discussed in the :doc:`08_support_resources` chapter.

Community health unit contacts can be listed and created at
``/api/common/contacts/``. To list a community health unit to a contact,
``POST`` to that endpoint the ``id`` of the contact and the ``id`` of the
community health unit. The example payload below illustrates that:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "health_unit": "2d425ab7-0002-4b95-9cd1-638972efb75d",
        "contact": "7dd62ab9-94c2-48d6-a10f-d903bd57acd5"
    }

Community Health Unit Approvals
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The approval status of community health units is listed / maintained at
``/api/chul/unit_approvals/``.

To record a new approval, you should supply a ``comment``, ``approval_date``,
``approver``, ``approval_status`` and ``health_unit``.

The ``approver`` is the ``id`` of an approver registered at
``/api/chul/approvers/``. The ``approval_status`` is the ``id`` of an
approval status registered at ``/api/chul/approval_statuses/``.
The ``health_unit`` is the ``id`` of a community health unit registered at
``/api/chul/units/``. The ``comment`` is a free-text explanation, while the
``approval_date`` is an ISO 8601 **date** ( not datetime ) string that
represents the date when the approval occured.

The following example is a valid ``POST`` payload:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "comment": "For documentation / training purposes",
        "approval_date": "2015-05-09",
        "approver": "02b610c1-067f-4e0c-9bad-31cc029f6ee3",
        "approval_status": "44c2abfd-3944-484f-ae4c-b30778e25398",
        "health_unit": "96645d26-8e4e-4078-9e10-a5176f5432df"
    }

.. note::

    This reflects the approval status of the Community Health Unit.

Community Health Workers
--------------------------
Community health workers are attached to community health units. They are
listed and maintained at ``/api/chul/workers/``.

When registering a new community health worker, supply a ``first_name``,
``last_name``, ``surname``, ``id_number`` and ``health_unit``. The
``health_unit`` is the ``id`` of the community health unit that the worker
is attached to, and can be retrieved from ``/api/chul/units/``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "first_name": "Does",
        "last_name": "Not",
        "surname": "Exist",
        "id_number": 545432,
        "health_unit": "96645d26-8e4e-4078-9e10-a5176f5432df"
    }

Community Health Workers Contacts
------------------------------------
A community health worker can be linked to a contact that has already been
registered at ``/api/common/contacts/`` by ``POST`` ing to
``/api/chul/workers_contacts/`` the ``id`` of the worker and the ``id`` of the
contact.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "health_worker": "db04b653-b0f7-434f-a224-3ea4d93b69c1",
        "contact": "2d04afdc-46a8-4b11-85b8-63f5c035366f"
    }

Community Health Workers Approvals
-------------------------------------
The approval status of community health workers is maintained at
``/api/chul/worker_approvals/``.

The key pieces of information to maintain about each approval are
the ``approver`` ( an ``id`` of an approver registered at
``/api/chul/approvers/`` ), ``approval_status`` ( ``id`` of an
approval status registered at ``/api/chul/approval_statuses/`` )
and ``health_worker`` ( ``id`` of a health worker registered at
``/api/chul/workers/`` ) and a free-form ``comment``.

The example below is a valid ``POST`` payload:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "approver": "02b610c1-067f-4e0c-9bad-31cc029f6ee3",
        "approval_status": "44c2abfd-3944-484f-ae4c-b30778e25398",
        "health_worker": "db04b653-b0f7-434f-a224-3ea4d93b69c1",
        "comment": "Documentation example"
    }
