The API sandbox
============================
Our experience teaches us that the biggest roadblock to systems integration
is usually communication. Developers operate at a level of precision and
detail that is alien to most people. We've been spoilt by our past dabblings
with high quality API documentation sites like the `Stripe API site`_.

.. _`Stripe API site`: https://stripe.com/docs/api

Swagger
--------
The API can be interacted with through Swagger from the link ``api/explore/``

The Browsable API
------------------
The  API is accesible from the URL ``api/``. This is the entry point into the
entire list of all the URLs in the API and the methods and that are allowed on an
endpoint.

API Metadata support
--------------------
The ``api/`` URL has been designed to make it easy for a client accessing an endpoint
to know the methods that are allowed on the endpoint. The metadata support also allows
a client to know the fields that an endpoint accepts and whether they are required or
not.
